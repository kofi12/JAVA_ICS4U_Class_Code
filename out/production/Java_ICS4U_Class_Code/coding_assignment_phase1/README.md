# Overall Objective

- This coding assignment is meant to test and reinforce your understanding of basic concepts, including methods, 1D arrays, loops, if-else ect.

- You'll be creating a simple Zoon Management System
- Don't worry you won't be creating an actual fully featured and functional system, just a very minimal fictitious one

## Specification

- Create a single Java file `ZooManagementSystem.java`
- define methods to handle different functionalities of the zoo management system

- Use 3 arrays to store information about the animals: one for names, one for species and one for ages
- Create the following methods
  - `public static void addAnimal(String[] names, String[] species, int ages[], int count, String name, String specie, int age)`
    - Adds an animal to the zoo
  - `public static void listAllAnimals(String[] names, String species, int[] ages, int count)`
    - Prints the details of all animals in the zoo
  - `public static boolean findAnimalByName(String[] names)`
    - Finds and displays the animal

### Coding Standards

- Follow proper Java naming conventions for methods, variables ect.
- Comment your code to explain the purpose of methods and any complex logic
- Make sure your code is readable and well-organized

#### Important

- Make sure to run and test your code, code that doesn't run won't pass
- TODO
